		<description><![CDATA[Crown of Queen Anne is a City of Seattle Landmark called Queen Anne Boulevard that already has many Greenway characteristics. It is not an Olmsted boulevard, but rather the community's response to John C. Olmsted's 1903 park plan. With minor investments in signage and pedestrian improvements, "the Crown" will be a crown jewel of the city's Neighborhood Greenway system.]]></description>

Going west is treacherous since Queen Anne Drive curves around just here coming from the George Washington Bridge.]]></description>
