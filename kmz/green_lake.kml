				<name>P1 - Sharrows and McDonald School Crossing of St at Latona</name>
				<description><![CDATA[This is an extremely important crossing--although it's not associated with a proposed greenway route, it is the crossing for the sharrows on Latona and Thackeray. It is also the location of a designated crossing for McDonald International and will be assigned a crossing guard because of the hazard of crossing at this location. <br><br>The transition of the northbound-southbound couplet of Thackeray and Latona to the south to the two-way street of Latona to the north creates a confusing and dangerous situation for pedestrians and cyclists.<br><br>Two blocks to the west, the eastbound channels transition from one lane to two, and motorists are increasing their speeds and spreading traffic into two lanes as they approach the freeway onramps.<br><br>The combination of sharrows, designated elementary school crossing, the couplet and one of the more highly traveled E-W arterials in north Seattle make at least as important as the crossing of 50th by the P1 route at Sunnyside.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[50th Street divides the McDonald School reference area. Children well within biking or walking distance need better options for crossings. This intersection is also the location of the P1 route for the Wallingford-Green Lake Greenway alignment. <br><br>Children coming from the Wallingford Co-op Preschool need to cross three streets to get to the Meridian Playground. The traffic signal here is not optimized for pedestrians or bikes--it is a very short signal.<br><br> Because of all the needs this crossing serves--kids from Meridian School, the McDonald International School, the Wallingford Co-op, the P1 Greenway route, and other users of the Meridian Playground, this crossing needs better infrastructure and signaling.]]></description>
