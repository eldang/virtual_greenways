		<description><![CDATA[West Seattle currently has several North-South routes mapped out, all in the Delridge district.  Two (21st and 26th) were named as 2012 candidates by the city, while one (highland park) is proposed for future consideration.  East/West routes are tricky in West Seattle due to the steep terrain.  The Brandon Street route has been proposed by some neighbors: it would combine quiet streets with some new staircases through linear parks.]]></description>
