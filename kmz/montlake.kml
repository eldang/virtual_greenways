		<description><![CDATA[The Montlake area offers a convergent street and trail system (one of 4 Northat is in need of rationalization in the context of the SR520 highway reconstruction.  It serves local residents as well as commuters going to and from the UW and soon the Rail Station.  It is a highly congested area that is both rich in terms of its features (Olmsted Parks, Arboretum, Waterfront, golf and sports fields), and in terms of transportation challenges.  Pedestrians and Bicyclists have not been considered seriously by WSDOT resulting in awkward and dangerous intersections at SR520, and higher pressure on current arterials and sub-arterials that will make walking and biking more dangerous in Montlake itself.  The wealth of green space, access to the railways and bus system make Montlake a transportation resource as well as one of the major destination for cyclists and pedestrians from the entire greater downtown and UW areas.  Greenways and other bike lanes in Montlake are of city and region importanc]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Main access point for Montlakers entering Interlaken Park or walking to 19th Ave E restaurants and cafes.  This staircase is also the main access to Montlake for Capitol Hill residents  commuting to the UW on foot or on bicycle.  The Boyer Clinic young patients would love to use it more often but the absence of a marked crosswalk and the fact that the staircase doesn't have a ramp allowing passage for multi-kid strollers makes it impossible.  The kids are not routed through the 24th/Interlaken intersection because it is too dangerous.  Bicyclists (commuters and casual users cross Boyer at 23rd Ave E and user the S sidewalk of Boyer and then the W sidewalk of 24th as a bike lane for lack of better option.  A ramp replacing the staircase would solve the problem.]]></description>
