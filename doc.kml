				<description><![CDATA[There is no easy way up the hill, but this is about the easiest way going! We scouted this route Sunday, September 9, 2012 and found the easiest grades block-by-block. The goal of this route is to provide a family-friendly biking and walking route with the fewest steep climbs possible from the Burke-Gilman trail to a planned Phinney Ridge greenway to the north on Greenwood Ave.<br><br>The biggest challenges are at 36th, 39th, and 46th Streets. Phinney is preferable immediately north of the BGT because it connects directly to the trail and has a light for crossing 36th; a bit farther north Greenwood is preferable because it connects to Bowdoin Pl. and the rest of our route with the easiest grade. On our trip we used the north sidewalk of 39th; this is not an ideal way to connect these places.]]></description>
